project breif

BrainMiles is an AI-powered learning platform that rewards people with real money for gaining knowledge.
Users can pick any topic, article, or book, and our system — powered by Gemini AI — instantly creates fun, personalized quiz questions based on it.
When users answer correctly, they earn cash rewards, motivating them to learn more and stay curious.
The reward fund is supported by public contributions, making BrainMiles a community-powered movement that values education and curiosity.
By combining AI, gamified learning, and real rewards, BrainMiles turns reading and learning into an exciting journey — where every correct answer helps you grow smarter and earn more.
